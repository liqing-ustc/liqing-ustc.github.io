I am a Research Scientist at Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence (BIGAI). I received my Ph.D. in 2022 from Department of Statistics at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), advised by Professor Song-Chun Zhu. During my Ph.D., I have interned at Google Research, Microsoft Azure AI and Amazon Alexa. Before UCLA, I obtained my degrees of Bachelor in 2015 and Master in 2018 from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). My research interests lie in machine learning, computer vision, and multimodal learning.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
