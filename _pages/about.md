I am a research scientist and team lead at <a href='https://www.bigai.ai'>Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence (BIGAI)</a>, China. I received my Ph.D. in 2022 from Department of Statistics at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), advised by Professor Song-Chun Zhu. During my Ph.D., I have interned at Google Research, Microsoft Azure AI and Amazon Alexa. Before UCLA, I obtained my degrees of Bachelor in 2015 and Master in 2018 from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). 

My research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, cognition, and robotics. My current research themes include:
- **Multimodal Understanding**: vision & language understanding, visual reasoning, 3D scene understanding, video understanding
- **General Machine Learning**: neural-symbolic reasoning and learning, structure learning, representation learning, generative modeling, few-shot learning
- **Embodied Agents**: language-grounded task planning, reinforcement learning, robotics

**Our team is actively recruiting full-time research scientists, engineers, and self-motivated interns. We are also seeking prospective PhD students and long-term collaborators for [TongProgam (通计划)](https://www.bigai.ai/tongprogram/). Feel free to contact me if you are interested!**
