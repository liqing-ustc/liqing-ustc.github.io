I am a research scientist and team lead at [Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence (BIGAI)](https://www.bigai.ai), China. I received my Ph.D. in 2022 from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), advised by Professor [Song-Chun Zhu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/). During my Ph.D., I have interned at Google Research, Microsoft Azure AI and Amazon Alexa. Before UCLA, I obtained my degrees of Bachelor in 2015 and Master in 2018 from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). 

Currently, I focus on developing ***language agents*** for general ***computer use*** via ***agentic RL***.
