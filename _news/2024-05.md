Two papers are accepted by ICML 2024. They are about 3D embodied generalist agent (**[LEO](https://embodied-generalist.github.io/)**) and end-to-end neural-symbolic RL for explainable decision-making (**[INSIGHT](https://ins-rl.github.io/)**). Congrats [Jiangyong Huang](https://huangjy-pku.github.io/) et al. and [Lirui Luo](https://liruiluo.github.io/) et al.!
